# Star Wars RPG

What the project does:

This is a very simple and "fun" Star Wars themed game where you can select a character to play throughout the game. You attack the remaining enemies and try surive.  A minimal amount of strategy is involved.

Why the project is useful:

This game may be helpful for those who are trying to learn the basics of jquery and element manipulation in concert with a simple game mechanic.
